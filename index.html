<!-- Create an array of cars in the inventory.json file
(see example structure below). Put at least three
cars in the array.

When your page first loads, you need to use an XHR
to load the contents of the JSON file, and parse
them into a native JavaScript object.

Loop over your array of cars and build up an HTML
string to build a card for each car. Also, use
Bootstrap to create rows. Each row should contain
3 columns. Make sure you have a parent element
with a class of container. -->
